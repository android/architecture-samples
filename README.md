# todo-mvp

This version of the app is called todo-mvp-kotlin, and provides a foundation for other kotlin samples in this project. The sample aims to:

* Provide a basic [Model-View-Presenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter) (MVP) architecture without using any architectural frameworks.
* Act as a reference point for comparing and contrasting the other kotlin samples in this project.
* Leverage idiomatic kotlin to improve readability and limit verbosity, as compared to the TODO-MVP java project.

This sample is a work in progress.

# Dependencies
*  Kotlin stdlib
*  kotlin-android plugin
