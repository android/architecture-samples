1.2  Procedure 2: Cloning A Repository 
Step 1: Install Git 
If you don't have Git installed, you can download and install it from the official website: Git 
Downloads 
Step 2: Open a Terminal or Command Prompt or powershell 
Open your terminal or command prompt. This could be Git Bash, Command Prompt 
(Windows), or Terminal (Mac/Linux). 
Step 3: Navigate to the Desired Directory 
Navigate to the directory on your local disk where you want to clone the repository. You can 
use the cd command to change directories. For example: 
cd path/to/your/directory 
Step 4: Get the Repository URL 
Go to the GitHub repository you want to clone and copy the repository URL. You can find it 
on the repository's page, usually under the "Code" button. 
Step 5: Clone the Repository 
Use the git clone command to clone the repository. Replace <repository_url> with the actual 
URL you copied. 
git clone <repository_url> 
For example: 
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git 
Step 6: Enter Credentials (if required) 
If the repository is private, Git may prompt you to enter your GitHub username and password 
or personal access token. 
Step 7: Verify the Cloning Process 
23BCAB23 Basics of Open Source Demystified
 Kristu Jayanti College (Autonomous) 3
Git will download the repository to your local disk. Once the process is complete, you should 
see a new directory with the repository name in your specified local directory. 
Step 8: Navigate into the Cloned Repository 
Navigate into the cloned repository directory using the cd command: cd repository

1.3  Procedure 3: Forking A Repository 
1. Navigate to the Repository: Go to the repository you want to fork on the Git hosting platform
 (e.g., GitHub).
 2. Click the “Fork” Button: Look for the “Fork” button usually located in the upper right corner
 of the repository page. Clicking this button will initiate the forking process.
 3. Choose Where to Fork: If you have multiple accounts or organizations, you might be
 prompted to choose where to fork the repository.
 4. Wait for Forking to Complete: The platform will create a copy of the repository under your
 account. This process may take a few moments, depending on the size of the repository.
 5. Clone Your Fork: Once the forking process is complete, clone your forked repository to your
 local machine using the git clone command. Replace <repository_URL> with the URL of your
 forked repository: git clone <repository_URL>
 6. Make Changes: Now you can make changes to the code, add new features, fix bugs, etc., in
 your local copy of the repository.

1.4  Procedure 4: Performing The First Commit 
1. Initialize a Git Repository: If you haven’t already done so, navigate to the root directory of
 your project in the terminal and initialize a new Git repository using the following command:
 git init
 2. Add Files to the Staging Area: Use the git add command to add files or directories to the
 staging area. For example, to add all files in the current directory and its subdirectories, you
 can use: git add .
 3. Commit the Changes: Once you’ve added the files to the staging area, you can commit them
 to the repository using the git commit command. This command will open a text editor (usually
 Vim or Nano) for you to enter a commit message. git commit
 4. Alternatively, you can provide a commit message directly on the command line using the 
m flag: git commit -m "Initial commit"
 5. Verify the Commit: After committing, you can use git log to view the commit history and
 verify that your first commit was successful: git log

1.5  Procedure 5: Push Changes to Repository 
To push changes to a repository on GitHub using a personal access token (PAT), follow these 
steps: 
Commit Changes: Make the necessary changes to your files in your local repository. 
Stage Changes: Use the git add command to stage the changes you want to include in the 
commit. For example: 
git add . 
Commit Changes: Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message using the git commit 
command. For example: 
git commit -m "Your commit message here" 
Push Changes: Use the git push command to push your commits to the remote repository on 
GitHub. Include your PAT in the URL as a password. The syntax is similar to the clone 
command but with git push instead of git clone. For example: 
git push  https://<your-username>:<your-token>@github.com/<your- 
username>/<repository>.git 
Replace <your-username> with your GitHub username, <your-token> with the token you 
generated, and <repository> with the name of your repository. 
Enter Credentials: You may be prompted to enter your GitHub username and the PAT you 
generated. Enter them when prompted. 
Verify Changes: Once the push is successful, visit your repository on GitHub to verify that the 
changes have been pushed successfully. 
    Important Notes: 
Treat your personal access token like a password. Keep it secure and do not share it publicly.

It's recommended to use HTTPS for pushing changes to repositories when using a personal 
access token. 
If you're pushing to a repository where you have write access, your changes should now be 
reflected in the remote repository on GitHub.

1.6  Procedure 6: Pull Changes from Repository 
Make Changes in Remote Repository (Optional): If you want to make changes directly in the 
remote repository (e.g., via a web interface or another user's contribution), do so. 
Navigate to Your Repository Directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory of 
your local repository: cd C:\path\to\your\repository 
Pull Changes from Remote Repository: Use the git pull command to fetch and merge changes 
from the remote repository into your local repository. Specify the remote repository's name 
(typically origin) and the branch name (e.g., master): 
git pull origin master 
If you're pulling from a branch other than master, replace master with the appropriate branch 
name. 
Authentication (if prompted): If authentication is required, provide your credentials. 
Verify Updated Code: After the pull operation completes, verify that the changes made directly 
in the remote repository are now reflected in your local repository.

1.10 Procedure 10: Perform Merge Conflict 
Pull the Latest Changes: Before making any changes, ensure your local repository is up-to- 
date with the remote repository. Pull the latest changes from the remote branch you intend to 
merge into. 
git checkout <your_branch> 
    git pull origin <remote_branch> 
Merge the Target Branch: Merge the target branch into your current branch. 
git merge <target_branch> 
Resolve Merge Conflicts: If there are conflicting changes, Git will notify you about the 
conflicts and mark them in the affected files. You need to manually resolve these conflicts. 
Open Files with Conflicts: Open the conflicted files in your preferred text editor. Git marks the 
conflicting sections within the file using special markers like <<<<<<<, =======, and 
>>>>>>>. 
Resolve Conflicts Manually: Inside the conflicted file(s), locate the conflicting sections marked 
by Git and decide how to resolve them. You can choose to keep one version of the code, 
combine both versions, or write an entirely new version. Remove the conflict markers 
(<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>) once you've resolved the conflicts. 
Stage the Changes: After resolving the conflicts, stage the changes using the git add command. 
git add <conflicted_file(s)> 
Commit the Changes: Once you've resolved all conflicts in the files, commit the changes. 
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"

1.11 Procedure 11: Branching 
Creating a Branch: You can create a new branch directly on the GitHub website or using Git 
commands locally on your machine (git checkout -b branch-name). 
Making Changes: After creating a branch, you can make changes to the codebase, add new 
files, modify existing ones, etc. 
Committing Changes: Once you've made changes, you commit them to the branch using git 
commit with a commit message describing the changes. 
Pushing Changes: If you're working locally, you push your branch to the GitHub repository 
using git push origin branch-name. 
Pull Request: When you're ready to merge your changes back into the main codebase, you 
create a pull request (PR) on GitHub. This allows others to review your changes before 
merging. 
Review and Merge: Other contributors review your changes in the pull request. Once 
approved, the changes are merged into the main branch. 
Deleting Branch: After merging, you can delete the branch both locally (git branch -d branch
name) and on GitHub, to keep your repository clean.

1.12 Procedure 12: Creating Personal Access, Token 
Git clone https://<your-username>:<your-token>@github.com/<your- 
username>/<repository>.git 
To create a personal access token (PAT) on GitHub, you can follow these steps: Log 
in to GitHub: Make sure you are logged in to your GitHub account. 
Access Settings: In the upper-right corner of GitHub, click on your profile picture, and then 
click on "Settings." 
Navigate to Developer Settings: In the left sidebar, click on "Developer settings," and then 
click on "Personal access tokens." 
Generate a New Token: Click on the "Generate token" button. 
Configure Token Settings: Enter a name for your token in the "Token name" field. 
Select the scopes (permissions) that your token should have. Be cautious and only grant the 
necessary permissions. 
Optionally, set an expiration period for the token. 
Generate Token: Click the "Generate token" button at the bottom. 
Copy the Token: GitHub will generate the token. Copy the token immediately as you won't 
be able to see it again. 
Important Notes: Treat your personal access token like a password. Keep it secure and do not 
share it publicly. 
23BCAB23 Basics of Open Source Demystified
 Kristu Jayanti College (Autonomous) 17
If you need to use the token in a command-line operation (e.g., for Git operations), include it 
in the URL as a password. For example: git clonehttps://<your-username>:<your- 
token>@github.com/<your-username>/<repository>.git 
Replace <your-username> with your GitHub username and <your-token> with the token you 
generated.
