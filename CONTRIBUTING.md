# How to become a contributor and submit your own code

To contribute with a small fix, simply create a pull request against the appropriate branch. This branch is usually [todo-mvp](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/todo-mvp) unless the change is related to a variant's implementation. See [Development branches](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/wiki/Development-branches) for more information or create an [issue](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/issues) if you're not sure what branch to target.

Before starting work on new sample intended for submission, please open an issue to discuss it with the team. This will allow us to review the architecture and frameworks used to determine if a spec-compatible app is likely to be accepted.

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Code style and structure

Please check out the [Code Style for Contributors](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html) section in AOSP. Also, check out the rest of the samples and maintain as much consistency with them as possible.

## Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your sample apps and patches! Before we can take them, we
have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you
    own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA](https://cla.developers.google.com).
  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
    then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA](https://cla.developers.google.com).
  * Please make sure you sign both, Android and Google CLA

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and
instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll be able to
accept your pull requests.
